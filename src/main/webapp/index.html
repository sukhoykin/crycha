			<message>1. It should be noted that no ethically-trained
			software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad
			procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to
			write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a
			parameter. </message>
			<message>2. I've said many, many times that the key to
			becoming an experienced software developer is to understand that you
			are, at all times, your own worst enemy. I don't mean this in a
			negative way â€“ you have to constantly plan for and design around your
			inevitable human mistakes and fallibility. It's fundamental to good
			software engineering because, well, we're all human. The
			good-slash-bad news is that you're only accidentally out to get
			yourself. But what happens when we're infinitely connected and
			software is suddenly everywhere, in everyone's pockets every moment
			of the day, starting to approximate a natural extension of our
			bodies? </message>
